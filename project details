Mini Project 1: Menu Driven Billing Calculator Using Python

1. Project Title:
Menu Driven Billing Calculator using Python

2. Problem Statement:
To design and implement a menu driven billing calculator that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, view total bill amount, and exit the program.

3. Objective:

To perform basic billing calculations.

To use menu driven programming.

To understand operators, input, and output.

To apply loops and conditional statements.

4. Tools Used:

Python 3

VS Code / IDLE

5. Description:
This project simulates a simple billing calculator. The user can choose options from a menu to:

Add item cost

Subtract discount

Multiply by quantity

Divide amount

Check total bill

Exit the program

The bill amount is updated after each operation, allowing the user to manage multiple items and apply calculations interactively.

6. Algorithm:

Initialize total bill amount.

Display the billing menu with options.

Read the user’s choice.

Perform the selected operation: add, subtract, multiply, or divide.

Display the updated bill amount.

Repeat the process until the user chooses to exit.

7. Result:
The menu driven billing calculator successfully performs arithmetic operations and updates the bill amount correctly.

8. Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how Python can be used to create a simple menu driven billing calculator. It helps in understanding fundamental programming concepts such as input/output, loops, conditional statements, and basic operators.
